## Armlab in ROB550 Robotics Systems Lab (Fall 2017) at The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
We implemented forward / inverse kinematics on a robotic arm. With a Kinect camera, the robotic arm is able to detect (via basic color filtering), pick, and place blocks with different colors. The video shows a block stacking task where the order of blocks was predefined.

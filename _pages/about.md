Hi! I am currently a research assistant at Intelligent Control Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interest is triggered by a broad range of human-robot interaction (HRI) applications, e.g., human decision prediction under ambiguous risks, fast robot learning on collaborative skills from human demonstration, robust object pose estimation in adversarial environments, etc. To address challenges in HRI, a highly interdisciplinary area, I leverage techniques from multiple areas, including inverse reinforcement learning, reinforcement learning, meta learning, probabilistic robotics, and deep learning. My ultimate goal is to build robotics systems that can collaborate with humans safely, efficiently, and adaptively.
